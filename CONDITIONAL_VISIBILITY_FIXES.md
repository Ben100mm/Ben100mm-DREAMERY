# Conditional Visibility Fixes - UnderwritePage

## Summary
Fixed conditional visibility logic to ensure accurate field display based on property type, operation type, and finance type combinations.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Single Family Monthly Rent Field Visibility (Lines 7881-7923)
**Problem**: Monthly Rent field showed for ALL Single Family properties, even for STR and Rental Arbitrage operations which use nightly rates.

**Fix**: Added conditional to hide Monthly Rent when operation type is STR or Rental Arbitrage:
```typescript
{state.propertyType === "Single Family" &&
state.operationType !== "Short Term Rental" &&
state.operationType !== "Rental Arbitrage" ? (
  // Monthly Rent field
) : ... }
```

**Impact**: 
- Single Family + Buy & Hold/Fix & Flip/BRRRR → Shows Monthly Rent ✓
- Single Family + STR/Rental Arbitrage → Hidden (uses nightly rate fields) ✓

### 2. Enhanced STR Settings for Rental Arbitrage (Lines 11222-11245, 11579-11586)
**Problem**: Enhanced STR Revenue Model excluded Rental Arbitrage operations, which also use nightly rates and similar calculations.

**Fix**: Added Rental Arbitrage to conditionals:
```typescript
{(state.propertyType === "Hotel" ||
  state.operationType === "Short Term Rental" ||
  state.operationType === "Rental Arbitrage") && (
```

**Impact**: Rental Arbitrage operations now have access to enhanced revenue modeling tools.

### 3. Furniture Costs for Rental Arbitrage
**Problem**: Furniture costs were only included for "Short Term Rental" but not "Rental Arbitrage" in multiple calculations.

**Fix**: Updated all cash invested calculations to include furniture costs for Rental Arbitrage:
- Lines 705-716: Cash-on-Cash calculation
- Lines 804-815: ROI with confidence calculation
- Lines 1521-1535: CoC annual calculation
- Lines 1757-1770: MOIC calculation
- Lines 1969-1981: Cash-on-cash validation

**Impact**: Rental Arbitrage now properly accounts for furniture/startup costs in all financial metrics.

### 4. Rental Arbitrage Cash Investment Calculations
**Problem**: Cash invested calculations incorrectly included purchase price, down payment, and closing costs for Rental Arbitrage operations.

**Fix**: Created separate calculation logic for Rental Arbitrage:
```typescript
const cashInvested = state.operationType === "Rental Arbitrage"
  ? // Rental Arbitrage: only startup costs, no purchase/down payment/closing
    (state.arbitrage?.deposit || 0) +
    (state.arbitrage?.estimateCostOfRepairs || 0) +
    (state.arbitrage?.furnitureCost || 0) +
    (state.arbitrage?.otherStartupCosts || 0) +
    (state.loan.rehabCosts || 0)
  : // Traditional purchase: down payment + closing + rehab + furniture (if STR)
    state.loan.downPayment +
    (state.loan.closingCosts || 0) +
    (state.loan.rehabCosts || 0) +
    (state.operationType === "Short Term Rental" ? state.arbitrage?.furnitureCost || 0 : 0);
```

**Impact**: 
- Rental Arbitrage ROI, CoC, and other metrics now correctly calculate based on actual cash invested
- No longer includes irrelevant purchase-related costs

### 5. Total Cash Required Display (Lines 6697-6745)
**Problem**: 
- Purchase price was always included in Total Cash Required, even for Rental Arbitrage
- Label didn't reflect the different meaning for Rental Arbitrage

**Fix**: 
```typescript
// Purchase Price field shows $0 with different label for Rental Arbitrage
label={state.operationType === "Rental Arbitrage" ? "Property Value (Ref Only)" : "Purchase Price"}
value={formatCurrency(state.operationType === "Rental Arbitrage" ? 0 : state.purchasePrice || 0)}

// Total Cash Required excludes purchase price for Rental Arbitrage
(state.operationType === "Rental Arbitrage" ? 0 : state.purchasePrice || 0)
```

**Impact**: 
- Rental Arbitrage Total Cash Required now only includes: deposit + repairs + furniture + startup costs + rehab
- Clearer labeling prevents user confusion

#### Enhanced STR Revenue Model
**Visible**: Hotel OR Short Term Rental OR Rental Arbitrage

## Testing Recommendations

Test these key combinations:
1. ✓ Single Family + Buy & Hold + Conventional → Should show monthly rent
2. ✓ Single Family + STR + Hard Money → Should show nightly rate, NOT monthly rent
3. ✓ Single Family + Rental Arbitrage + Cash → Should show nightly rate, startup costs only
4. ✓ Hotel + STR + DSCR → Should show unit configuration, enhanced STR model
5. ✓ Office + Rental Arbitrage + Private → Should show FF&E fields, no purchase price
6. ✓ Multi Family + BRRRR + Hard Money → Should show traditional loan fields
7. ✓ Land + Fix & Flip + Hard Money → Should show limited finance options
8. ✓ Retail + Buy & Hold + SBA → Should show commercial fields, SBA option

## Recent Updates (October 2025)

### Dead Code Removal - Risk Assessment Section
**Date**: October 9, 2025

Removed 266 lines of permanently disabled Risk Assessment code from UnderwritePage.tsx (previously lines 8992-9255).

**Reason**: Code was disabled with `{false &&}` and marked as "disabled in favor of Analyze page". The functionality fully exists and is actively used in:
- `src/components/RiskAnalysisTab.tsx` (1,511 lines)
- Accessible via Advanced Modeling > Risk Analysis tab
- More comprehensive with Monte Carlo integration and better UX

**Impact**:
- ✅ Reduced UnderwritePage.tsx from 14,537 to 14,271 lines
- ✅ Removed redundant code without any user-facing changes
- ✅ Improved maintainability and reduced developer confusion
- ✅ Feature still fully available in its proper location
