**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Priority:** P3 - Low  
**Impact:** High  
**Effort:** 16+ hours  
**Date Completed:** October 7, 2025

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive year-by-year cash flow projection system that models detailed annual financial performance including rent growth, expense inflation, loan paydown, capital events, and property appreciation.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Core Module (`src/utils/cashFlowProjections.ts`)
- **Annual Projection Data Structure:** Complete yearly breakdown of all financial metrics
- **Growth Projections:** Rent growth, expense inflation, property appreciation
- **Loan Paydown Schedule:** Full amortization tracking with IO support
- **Capital Events System:** Major expenses and capital improvements tracking
- **NOI & Cash Flow Calculations:** Year-by-year operating income and cash flow
- **Metrics:** Cash-on-Cash, ROI, Cap Rate per year

#### Key Functions:
- `generateCashFlowProjections()` - Main orchestrator
- `projectMonthlyRent()` - Rent growth over time
- `projectAnnualExpenses()` - Expense inflation
- `projectPropertyValue()` - Appreciation with capital improvements
- `generateLoanPaydownSchedule()` - Amortization schedule

### 2. Visualization Component (`src/components/CashFlowProjectionChart.tsx`)
- **Interactive Charts:** Area, Line, and Bar chart styles
- **Multiple Views:**
  - Cash Flow (annual & cumulative)
  - Income & Expenses breakdown
  - Loan Paydown tracking
  - Property Value & Equity growth
- **Summary Cards:** Total returns, principal paydown, appreciation, annualized return
- **Detailed Table:** Year-by-year breakdown with all metrics
- **Capital Events:** Visual markers for major expenses

### 3. Excel Export (`src/utils/excelExport.ts`)
- **Multi-Sheet Workbooks:**
  - Summary Sheet: Key metrics and returns
  - Year-by-Year Details: Complete annual breakdown
  - Loan Schedule: Monthly amortization table
  - Capital Events: Scheduled improvements and expenses
- **Browser Download:** Direct Excel file download
- **CSV Export:** Single year export option

### 4. Capital Events Configuration (`src/components/CapitalEventsConfiguration.tsx`)
- **Event Management:** Add, edit, delete capital events
- **Event Types:** Roof, HVAC, Renovations, Repairs, etc.
- **Preset Templates:**
  - Roof Replacement (~$16k, 80% value add)
  - HVAC Replacement (~$7.5k, 70% value add)
  - Kitchen Renovation (~$25k, 100% value add)
  - Exterior Painting (~$6k, maintenance)
- **Capital Improvements:** Track value-add vs maintenance expenses
- **Year Planning:** Schedule events across projection period

### 5. Integration Tab (`src/components/CashFlowProjectionsTab.tsx`)
- **Settings Panel:**
  - Projection period (5-30 years)
  - Rent growth rate
  - Expense growth rate
  - Property appreciation rate
- **Auto-populated from DealState:**
  - Extracts revenue, expenses, loan details
  - Uses market conditions for growth rates
  - Calculates initial investment
- **Export Functionality:** Excel download with deal-specific filename
- **Key Insights:** Total return breakdown and final position summary

### 6. Comprehensive Testing (`src/utils/__tests__/cashFlowProjections.test.ts`)
- **26 Passing Tests** covering:
  - Rent growth calculations
  - Expense inflation
  - Property appreciation
  - Capital events
  - Loan paydown
  - Summary metrics
  - Interest-only loans
  - Cash-on-cash calculations
  - Equity growth

## Technical Specifications

### Dependencies Installed:
- `recharts` - Charting library for visualizations
- `xlsx` - Excel export functionality

### Data Flow:
1. User configures projection settings
2. System extracts deal parameters from DealState
3. `generateCashFlowProjections()` processes all calculations
4. Results displayed in interactive charts
5. Export to Excel for detailed analysis

### Key Calculations:

**Monthly Rent Growth:**
```typescript
rent_year_n = initialRent × (1 + growthRate)^(n-1)
```

**Annual Expenses with Inflation:**
```typescript
expenses_year_n = initialExpenses × (1 + inflationRate)^(n-1)
```

**Property Value with Appreciation:**
```typescript
value_year_n = initialValue × (1 + appreciationRate)^(n-1) + capitalImprovements
```

**Cash Flow:**
```typescript
cashFlow = NOI - debtService - capitalEvents
```

**Annualized Return:**
```typescript
annualizedReturn = (1 + totalReturn/investment)^(1/years) - 1
```

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { generateCashFlowProjections, CapitalEventType, createCapitalEvent } from './utils/cashFlowProjections';

// Define capital events
const roofReplacement = createCapitalEvent(
  5, // Year 5
  CapitalEventType.ROOF_REPLACEMENT,
  15000,
  'Replace main house roof',
  true, // Is capital improvement
  0.8   // 80% value add
);

// Generate projections
const results = generateCashFlowProjections({
  purchasePrice: 500000,
  initialMonthlyRent: 3000,
  vacancyRate: 0.05,
  annualTaxes: 6000,
  annualInsurance: 1200,
  annualMaintenance: 3000,
  annualManagement: 3600,
  annualCapEx: 2400,
  loanAmount: 400000,
  annualInterestRate: 0.05,
  loanTermMonths: 360,
  growthRates: {
    rentGrowthRate: 0.03,
    expenseGrowthRate: 0.025,
    propertyAppreciationRate: 0.04
  },
  capitalEvents: [roofReplacement],
  projectionYears: 10,
  initialInvestment: 100000
});

// Access results
console.log(results.summary.totalReturn);
console.log(results.summary.annualizedReturn);
console.log(results.yearlyProjections[0].cashFlowAfterCapEx);
```

## Integration with UnderwritePage

The Cash Flow Projections tab can be added to UnderwritePage:

import CashFlowProjectionsTab from './components/CashFlowProjectionsTab';

// In UnderwritePage component:
<Tab label="Cash Flow Projections" />

// In tab panel:
<CashFlowProjectionsTab dealState={dealState} />
```

## Dependencies Note

The following dependencies were installed with `--legacy-peer-deps` flag due to TypeScript version conflicts with Prisma:
- recharts@2.14.1
- xlsx@0.18.5

This is a known compatibility issue and does not affect functionality.
