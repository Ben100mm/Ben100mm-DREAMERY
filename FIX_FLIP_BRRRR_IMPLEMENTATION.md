- ‚úÖ BRRRR accordion properly implemented
- ‚úÖ Conditional visibility accurate for all combinations
- ‚úÖ Proper calculator mode integration
- ‚úÖ Consistent with design patterns

## Files Modified
- `/Users/benjamin/dreamery-homepage/src/pages/UnderwritePage.tsx` (added 370 lines)
  - Added Fix & Flip Calculator accordion (lines 7306-7472)
