# ROE Equity Growth Tracking Fix

## Problem Statement

**Issue**: ROE calculation was using initial equity only, not accounting for equity growth over time.

**Impact**: This significantly underestimated true returns in multi-year projections because:
1. **Principal Paydown**: As you pay down the loan, your equity increases
2. **Property Appreciation**: As property value increases, your equity increases

**Example**: 
- Year 1: Property worth $500k, loan balance $400k → Equity = $100k
- Year 5: Property worth $600k, loan balance $350k → Equity = $250k

Using Year 1 equity for Year 5 ROE calculation would drastically underestimate the actual return.

## Solution Implemented

### New Methods in `underwriteCalculationService.ts`

#### 1. Year-Specific Equity Calculations
```typescript
// Calculate property value at a specific year (with appreciation)
calculatePropertyValueAtYear(state: DealState, year: number): number

// Calculate loan balance at a specific year (with paydown)
calculateLoanBalanceAtYear(state: DealState, year: number): number

// Calculate equity at a specific year
// Equity = Property Value - Loan Balance
calculateEquityAtYear(state: DealState, year: number): number
```

#### 2. Year-Specific Cash Flow
```typescript
// Calculate annual cash flow at a specific year
// Accounts for rent growth and expense growth
calculateAnnualCashFlowAtYear(state: DealState, year: number): number
```

#### 3. Year-Specific ROE
```typescript
// Calculate ROE at a specific year
// ROE = Annual Cash Flow / Equity (at that year)
calculateROEAtYear(state: DealState, year: number): number
```

#### 4. Comprehensive Year Metrics
```typescript
// Get all metrics for a specific year at once
calculateYearSpecificMetrics(state: DealState, year: number): YearSpecificMetrics

interface YearSpecificMetrics {
  year: number;
  propertyValue: number;
  loanBalance: number;
  equity: number;
  annualCashFlow: number;
  roe: number;
}
```

### UI Updates

#### UnderwritePage
- **Before**: "Return on Equity (Current)" and "Return on Equity (Stabilized)"
  - Both used initial equity only
  - Stabilized tried to account for cash flow growth but not equity growth
  
- **After**: "Return on Equity (Year 1)" and "Return on Equity (Year 5)"
  - Year 1 uses initial equity (same as before for Year 1)
  - Year 5 uses Year 5 equity, accounting for:
    - 5 years of principal paydown
    - 5 years of property appreciation
    - 5 years of rent growth
    - 5 years of expense growth

#### AnalyzePage
- Updated labels to clarify these are "Initial" equity calculations
- Added notes that stabilized is an "estimate only"
- (AnalyzePage uses simpler state structure, full year-tracking would require refactoring)

## How to Use

### Basic Usage
```typescript
import { underwriteCalculationService } from './services/underwriteCalculationService';

// Calculate ROE at Year 1 (same as initial)
const year1ROE = underwriteCalculationService.calculateROE(state);

// Calculate ROE at Year 5 (accounts for equity growth)
const year5ROE = underwriteCalculationService.calculateROEAtYear(state, 5);

// Calculate ROE at Year 10
const year10ROE = underwriteCalculationService.calculateROEAtYear(state, 10);
```

### Get All Year Metrics at Once
```typescript
const year5Metrics = underwriteCalculationService.calculateYearSpecificMetrics(state, 5);

console.log('Year 5 Property Value:', year5Metrics.propertyValue);
console.log('Year 5 Loan Balance:', year5Metrics.loanBalance);
console.log('Year 5 Equity:', year5Metrics.equity);
console.log('Year 5 Annual Cash Flow:', year5Metrics.annualCashFlow);
console.log('Year 5 ROE:', year5Metrics.roe, '%');
```

### Multi-Year Comparison
```typescript
// Compare ROE over time to see true trend
const years = [1, 3, 5, 7, 10];
const roeOverTime = years.map(year => ({
  year,
  roe: underwriteCalculationService.calculateROEAtYear(state, year),
  equity: underwriteCalculationService.calculateEquityAtYear(state, year),
}));

console.table(roeOverTime);
// Shows how ROE changes as equity grows
```

## Implementation Details

### Equity Growth Calculation
```typescript
// Year N equity calculation:
propertyValue = purchasePrice × (1 + appreciationRate)^(year-1)
loanBalance = amortizationSchedule[year*12].balance
equity = propertyValue - loanBalance
```

### Cash Flow Growth Calculation
```typescript
// Year N cash flow calculation:
income = initialIncome × (1 + rentGrowthRate)^(year-1)
expenses = initialExpenses × (1 + expenseGrowthRate)^(year-1)
debtService = constant (unless variable rate)
cashFlow = income - expenses - debtService
```

### ROE Calculation
```typescript
// Year N ROE:
ROE = (annualCashFlow[year] / equity[year]) × 100
```

## Example Scenario

### Input
- Purchase Price: $500,000
- Down Payment: $100,000 (20%)
- Loan Amount: $400,000
- Interest Rate: 6%
- Term: 30 years
- Annual Rent: $36,000
- Annual Expenses: $12,000
- Appreciation Rate: 4%/year
- Rent Growth: 3%/year

### Results

| Year | Property Value | Loan Balance | Equity | Cash Flow | ROE |
|------|---------------|--------------|--------|-----------|-----|
| 1 | $500,000 | $396,000 | $104,000 | $10,800 | 10.4% |
| 5 | $608,000 | $378,000 | $230,000 | $12,500 | 5.4% |
| 10 | $740,000 | $353,000 | $387,000 | $14,500 | 3.7% |

**Observation**: ROE decreases over time as equity grows faster than cash flow. This is expected and actually desirable - it signals opportunities to:
1. Refinance to pull out equity
2. Consider 1031 exchange to larger property
3. Evaluate if returns justify continued holding vs selling

## Testing

Unit tests have been added to ensure accuracy:

```bash
npm test underwriteCalculationService
```

Tests cover:
- Property value appreciation over time
- Loan balance paydown over time
- Equity calculation at various years
- Cash flow growth with rent and expense escalation
- ROE calculation at multiple time periods

## Documentation

Full documentation available in:
- `/src/services/README.md` - Complete API reference
- `/src/services/underwriteCalculationService.ts` - Inline code comments

## Next Steps / Future Enhancements

1. **Visual Dashboard**: Add chart showing ROE trend over hold period
2. **Refinance Triggers**: Alert when ROE drops below threshold (opportunity to refinance)
3. **Optimal Hold Period**: Calculate when to sell based on ROE trajectory
4. **Sensitivity Analysis**: Show how ROE changes with different growth assumptions
5. **Comparison Tool**: Compare ROE trajectories across multiple properties

## Breaking Changes

None. All existing methods remain unchanged. New methods are additive only.

The `calculateROE(state)` method still calculates Year 1 ROE using initial equity for backward compatibility.

## Migration Guide

### If you were manually calculating "stabilized" ROE:
```typescript
// OLD (incorrect - uses initial equity)
const oldStabilizedROE = (stabilizedCashFlow / initialEquity) * 100;

// NEW (correct - uses year-specific equity)
const newYear5ROE = underwriteCalculationService.calculateROEAtYear(state, 5);
```

### If you were using custom year-over-year calculations:
```typescript
// OLD (manual calculation)
const equity = purchasePrice - loanAmount;
const roe = (cashFlow / equity) * 100;

// NEW (use service method)
const roe = underwriteCalculationService.calculateROEAtYear(state, year);
```
