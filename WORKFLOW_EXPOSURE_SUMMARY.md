  - Tabbed interface for different workflow states
  - Card-based workflow overview with progress visualization
  - Pause/resume/delete workflow functionality
  - Detailed workflow view in modal dialog
  - Automatic step progression with dependency checking
  - LocalStorage persistence for workflow state
  - Auto-start next available step on completion

#### WorkflowDashboard Component (`src/components/workflows/WorkflowDashboard.tsx`)

- **Features**:
  - Overview statistics (total steps, estimated time, workflow type)
  - Workflow template visualization
  - Integration with WorkflowManager
  - Role-specific workflow display
  - Feature highlights and information
  - Responsive grid layout with Material-UI

### 2. Integration with Existing Systems

#### Updated RoleWorkspace Component
- Added import for WorkflowDashboard component
- Added AccountTreeIcon for workflow tabs
- Added "Workflows" tab to professional role configurations
- Integrated workflow rendering logic in tab system

#### Professional Roles with Workflow Access
The following professional roles now have access to structured workflows:

1. **Title Agent** (title-agent)
   - 5-step workflow: Order Intake → Title Search → Lien Check → Clear to Close → Settlement
   - Estimated time: ~5.5 hours

2. **Residential Appraiser** (residential-appraiser)
   - 6-step workflow: Order Acceptance → Property Inspection → Market Analysis → Report Drafting → QC Review → Report Delivery
   - Estimated time: ~10.25 hours

3. **General Contractor** (general-contractor)
   - 7-step workflow: Bid Submission → Contract Execution → Permit Management → Construction → Change Orders → Punch List → Project Completion
   - Estimated time: ~10+ days

4. **Insurance Agent** (insurance-agent)
   - 5-step workflow: Risk Assessment → Quote Generation → Policy Binding → Document Delivery → Claims Support
   - Estimated time: ~4.25 hours

### 3. Workflow Features

#### Progress Tracking
- Real-time progress visualization
- Completion percentage calculation
- Step status indicators (pending, in-progress, completed, blocked)
- Time tracking (estimated vs. actual)

#### Dependency Management
- Visual dependency indicators
- Automatic blocking of steps with incomplete dependencies
- Smart progression to next available step

#### State Persistence
- Workflows saved to localStorage
- Persistence across browser sessions
- Separate storage per role

#### Multi-Workflow Support
- Run multiple workflows concurrently
- Separate tracking for each workflow instance
- Tabbed view for active, completed, and paused workflows

## User Experience

### For Professional Users
1. Navigate to their role workspace (e.g., `/workspaces/professional-support`)
2. Select their professional role (Title Agent, Appraiser, etc.)
3. Click on the "Workflows" tab (new tab with tree icon)
4. View workflow template overview with all steps
5. Click "Start New Workflow" to begin
6. Progress through steps with visual guidance
7. Complete steps and track progress in real-time

### Workflow Actions
- **Start**: Begin a new workflow instance
- **View**: See detailed step-by-step progress
- **Complete Step**: Mark current step as done and auto-advance
- **Pause**: Temporarily stop workflow progress
- **Resume**: Continue paused workflow
- **Delete**: Remove completed or unwanted workflows

4. Custom workflow templates
5. Analytics and reporting
6. Integration with calendar/scheduling
7. Document attachment to workflow steps
8. Team assignment and collaboration
9. Workflow templates for more professional roles
10. Mobile app support

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test workflow creation for each professional role
2. Verify step progression with dependencies
3. Test pause/resume functionality
4. Verify localStorage persistence
5. Test multiple concurrent workflows
6. Verify responsive design on mobile devices
7. Test with different browsers

## Access Instructions

### For Development Testing
1. Start the development server
2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/workspaces/professional-support`
3. Use the role selector to choose a professional role with workflows
4. Click the "Workflows" tab to access the workflow dashboard

### For Production
1. Professional users navigate to their workspace
2. Workflows tab appears automatically for supported roles
3. No additional configuration required

## Notes
- Workflows are stored locally in the browser (localStorage)
- Each role has its own workflow template from WorkflowEngine
- Future backend integration will enable cross-device synchronization
- The system is fully functional and ready for user testing
