# Milky Way Panorama Placeholder

This is a placeholder for the Milky Way panorama texture.

To use the full interactive Milky Way panorama:

1. Download the ESO Milky Way panorama from:
   http://www.eso.org/public/images/eso0932a/

2. Save it as `milky-way-panorama.jpg` in the public directory

3. The component will automatically use the real panorama texture

The component includes a fallback procedural texture that creates a basic 
Milky Way-like appearance if the real texture is not available.

## Technical Details

- Expected format: Equirectangular projection (360Â° panorama)
- Recommended resolution: 2048x1024 or higher
- File format: JPG or PNG
- The component uses stereographic projection to map the equirectangular 
  texture onto a sphere for interactive viewing
